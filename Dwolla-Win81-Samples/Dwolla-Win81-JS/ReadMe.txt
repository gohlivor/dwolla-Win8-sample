Dwolla In-App SDK Samples  
=============================
The purpose of this SDK is to make it easy for developers to use Dwolla within your Windows 8 Store applications for in-app purchases.  The SDK works for both Windows 8 and 8.1 store apps.  There are two versions of the SDK - one for Javascript apps and one for XAML apps.

##Adding the package from NuGet
1. Create a new Windows 8 Store application or open an existing application.
2. Open the NuGet Package Manager (right-click on the Windows Store project and select "Manage NuGet Packages".
3. Make sure you select "Online" on the left and search online for "Dwolla In-App SDK".
4. You should see "Dwolla In-App SDK for Windows 8".  Select the correct package (XAML or Javascript) and click "Install".  You may be prompted to accept some projects which are referenced.  Select "I Accept".

The NuGet Package will be installed and you will notice a couple of items in the project.
- References now include:  Dwolla.InAppSDK

###For Javascript apps

- A new folder "dwollaSDK" has been added to your project.  This folder contains a html, Javascript, and CSS files that you can use in your project that performs the in-app purchase functionality.  It can be customized by the developer.

##Getting Started - Create a Dwolla application

To use the SDK you will need to register a free Dwolla application.  To do this go here: www.dwolla.com/applications.  Be sure to request the following "scopes" when registering your application.
- Balance
- AccountInfoFull
- Send
- Funding
- Transactions

Once your application is registered and approved you will have an App Key and App Secret.  You will need these in the SDK.

##Code updates for your project - Javascript apps

You should have a dwollaSDK folder in your project once you install the NuGet package.  You will need to make the following updates to get things wired up.

###default.html
- Add a reference to javascript files:

```
	<script src="/dwollaSDK/js/jquery.js"></script>
	<script src="/dwollaSDK/js/dwollaAPICore.js"></script>
```

- Add content to the body.  Here is an example:

```
    <div style="margin: 50px;">
        <h3>Sample for using the Dwolla In-App Purchase SDK</h3>
        <div>
            <button id="payButton">Pay with Dwolla</button>
            <button id="logout">Logout</button>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Transaction Id:</p>
            <p id="transactionId"></p>
            <br />
        </div>
        <div>
            <div id="dwolla_paynow"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
```

###default.js
- Add the following variables.

```
	//MerchantId is the Dwolla ID of the merchant who will receive the funds.
	var merchantId = "111-222-3333";

	//Enter your App Key & Secret here
	var appKey = "";
	var appSecret = "";
```

- Create instance of the DwollaAPI class in the app.onactivated event and add the callbacks

```
	app.onactivated = function (args) {
		if (args.detail.kind === activation.ActivationKind.launch) {
			if (args.detail.previousExecutionState !== activation.ApplicationExecutionState.terminated) {
				// TODO: This application has been newly launched. Initialize
				// your application here.
			} else {
				// TODO: This application has been reactivated from suspension.
				// Restore application state here.
			}

			args.setPromise(WinJS.UI.processAll().then(function () {

				// Subscribe to the Pay With Dwolla button
				payButton.addEventListener("click", DwollaAPI.payWithDwolla, false);
				$(document).on("DwollaSuccess", dwollaSuccessHandler);
				$(document).on("DwollaCancel", dwollaCancelHandler);

				//Initialize the DwollaAPI
		                DwollaAPI.setAmount(0.01);
				DwollaAPI.initialize(appKey, appSecret, merchantId, true);

				logout.addEventListener("click", DwollaAPI.logout, false);
			}));
		}
	};

    //Dwolla SDK event callbacks
    function dwollaSuccessHandler(e) {
        console.log("Dwolla payment success: TransactionId = " + e.message + " at " + e.time.toLocaleString());
    }
    function dwollaCancelHandler(e) {
        console.log("Dwolla payment cancelled at " + e.time.toLocaleString());
    }
```

When clicking on the Pay with Dwolla button you will want to do the following:

- Set the amount to charge:

```
	DwollaAPI.setAmount(0.01);
```

- Call the payWithDwolla function

```
	DwollaAPI.payWithDwolla
```
